# 🐍 Hex.tech career page scraper

I created this very teeny Python script that looks at Hex's career page and gets the list of their current job openings. I then created a Hex notebook that set to my email every Monday so I could proactively see if they had any new listings that I might be interested in. 

This project uses:
- 🐍 Python for coding everything
- 🥫 Beautiful Soup for scraping
- Hex for basic layout and visualization
