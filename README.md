# 🐍 Hex.tech career page scraper

I created this very teeny Python script that looks at Hex's career page and gets the list of their current job openings. I then created [a Hex notebook](https://app.hex.tech/katiesipos/app/ae4fd01b-b660-467b-be74-f782a68fded5/latest) that set to my email every Monday so I could proactively see if they had any new listings that I might be interested in. 

**This project uses:**
- 🐍 Python for coding everything
- 🥫 Beautiful Soup for scraping
- Hex for basic layout and visualization

If there are other companies that i'm interested in i'll probably make this more extensible but for now it's just a hardcoded URL. :)
